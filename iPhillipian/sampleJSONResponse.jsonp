With 11 seconds left, Rem Remmel \u201914 threw the disc to Graeme Henderson \u201914, who curved an outside-in forehand to Gabe Freund \u201913 to bring the score up to 11-12. The successful point that followed launched the two teams into \u201cuniversal point,\u201d or sudden death.</p>\n<p>\u201cThe most memorable part of the game was easily the last three points,\u201d said Remmel. \u201c[In the last point] after I pulled into the back corner of their in-zone, we stormed down the field and were able to mark our players before they got their first throw.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThen Piper got a d-block on the shaky throw that picked up the disc,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe, unfortunately, were not able to capitalize, and Andover High got the disc and worked it up the field for a point to win the game.\u201d </p>\n<p>The rainy weather and strong winds created an extra challenge for both teams as the disc became slippery and difficult to control. Despite the loss, outstanding performances from each member of the team in such harsh conditions as well as extraordinary cohesiveness made the game one of the season\u2019s best and showed the breadth of Andover\u2019s improvement.</p>\n<p>\u201cThough we were disappointed to have lost, I am certain that none of us were dejected because we played our best,\u201d continued Remmel. \u201cGabe [Freund \u201913] had an amazing game; he caught so many deep throws and played almost the whole game. It was especially amazing when one considers that at the beginning of the season, he had never played a game of Ultimate in his life.\u201d</p>\n<p>\u201cThat was the most competitive, intense and fun Andover Cup I have ever played,\u201d said Co-Captain Alec Tolentino \u201914. \u201cAlthough I am disappointed by the loss, I am by no means disappointed about how our team played in such terrible conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p>Additionally, the support from the crowd and each other was unprecedented and encouraged the team to persevere in the freezing weather.</p>\n<p>\u201cThroughout the whole game, I could hear our sideline cheering for us,\u201d said Curtis. \u201cThey were fired up even standing in the cold rain. They were our eighth player.\u201d </p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever felt more together as a team, fighting for this last game together and a last win for our seniors against another great team,\u201d said Dan Wang \u201914.</p>\n<p>After what was largely considered a rebuilding season, Andover Ultimate ended on a high note with a strong 8-9 record and positive mindset for next year.</p>\n<p>Tolentino said, \u201cWe played with heart, and some of our younger kids really stepped up, giving me hope that next year will be a great year.\u201d</p>","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.phillipian.net/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/IMG_8733005.tjohst251.tjohst.ultimate.jpg?itok=zpr-FifD\" width=\"400\" height=\"600\" />","square_thumbnail":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.phillipian.net/sites/default/files/styles/mobile_square_thumbnail/public/IMG_8733005.tjohst251.tjohst.ultimate.jpg?itok=x20ITonU\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" />","image_caption":"Anjali Krishnamachar '13 throws a low release backhand.","image_credit":"T.JOHST/THE PHILLIPIAN","url":"/articles/2013/05/31/team-falls-overtime","issue_date":"2013-05-31T00:00:00","article_date":"2013-05-31T01:09:22-04:00"},{"nid":"130114","section":"Sports","title":"Andover Drops Final Meet at Exeter","deck":"Track","writer":"Pranav Tadikonda","body":"<p>Both the boys and girls of Andover Track and Field fell to Exeter in Andover\u2019s final meet of the season on Saturday.</p>\n<p>The boys lost to Exeter 97-39, and the girls lost 75-60. </p>\n<p>For the boys, Babatunde Bello \u201913 won the 100m race and anchored the victorious 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams. </p>\n<p>For the girls, Camille Little \u201916 won the 100m and 200m races, and anchored the winning 4x100 group. </p>\n<p>The boys ended the season with a 2-3 record and the girls ended the season with a 1-4 record. </p>\n<p>Diana Tchadi \u201914 and Robert Rush \u201914 were voted Co-Captains for next season, and the members of Andover Track and Field are eagerly looking forward to next season.</p>","image":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.phillipian.net/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/311eavvakumova.track_.jpg?itok=ktaHsKeC\" width=\"400\" height=\"474\" />","square_thumbnail":"<img typeof=\"foaf:Image\" src=\"http://www.phillipian.net/sites/default/files/styles/mobile_square_thumbnail/public/311eavvakumova.track_.jpg?itok=TyQCRc95\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" />","image_caption":"Anoush Shehadeh '15 wins the 1500 m against Exeter","image_credit":"E.
